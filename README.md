# \# ⚡ Frequency

# \*A game made for \[Kenney Jam 2025](https://kenney.nl/jam)\*  

# 

# \## 🎮 About the Game  

# 

# \*\*Frequency\*\* is a 2D platformer where every door, hazard, and moving platform is tied to a specific \*\*power frequency\*\*.  

# The player must manipulate this frequency using a rotating dial to control the game world — changing what’s active, what’s safe, and what path is possible.

# 

# Created as a submission for \*\*Kenney Jam 2025\*\*, the game utilizes assets from the \[Kenney asset packs](https://kenney.nl/assets) and revolves around the jam's theme:  

# > \*"POWER!"\*  

# 

# \## 🔧 Core Features

# 

# \- 🎛️ \*\*Frequency Dial\*\*: Controlled with the right stick of a game controller to tune power frequencies.

# \- 🚪 \*\*Dynamic Level Elements\*\*:platforms and enemies respond to frequency values.

# 

# \## 🛠️ What I Did  

# 

# This project was solo-developed for the jam. Here's a breakdown of the systems I implemented:

# 

# \- Built the game using \*\*Godot 4.3\*\* with a fully responsive 2D physics environment.

# \- Designed a unique \*\*frequency mechanic\*\* that alters gameplay conditions in real-time.

# 

# \## 📦 Assets Used  

# 

# All visual and audio assets were sourced from \[Kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl/assets), in accordance with the jam’s requirements.

# 

# \## ✅ Status  

# 

# 🎉 \*\*Jam version complete\*\*  

# Additional polish and bug-fixing may happen post-jam.
